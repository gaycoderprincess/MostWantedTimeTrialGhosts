## Building

Building is done on an Arch Linux system with CLion and vcpkg being used for the build process. 

Before you begin, clone [nya-common](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common), [nya-common-nfsmw](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common-nfsmw) and [CwoeeMenuLib](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/CwoeeMenuLib) to folders next to this one, so they can be found.

Required packages: `mingw-w64-gcc`

You should be able to build the project now in CLion.
